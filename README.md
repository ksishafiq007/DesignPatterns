# Design Patterns
Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. 

Types of Design Patterns:
 1. Creational Patterns
 2. Structural Patterns
 3. Behavioral Patterns.
 
# Singleton pattern: Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. The Single Ton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.

# Factory design pattern: The factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.

# Abstract factory design pattern: Abstract factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories. This factory is also called as factory of factories. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object. The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes.
